                <h2>Benefits of the game:</h2>
                    <p>Memory is a fun game for all ages with many health benefits. While physical activities help
                        strengthen the body, intellectual games like memory sharpen our cognitive abilities to improve concentration,
                        attention to detail and focus, among other skills.</p>
                    <p>Matching memory games help strengthen visual recognition skills by pairing related images, thus
                        improving observation skills to differentiate between two images.</p>
                    <p>In children, playing memory can enhance critical thinking skills in their ability to process and
                        organize information to reach a conclusion and make a decision.</p>
                    <p>Though memory games are focused on developing the short-term memory, they can also help prevent
                        memory-related illnesses in adulthood.</p>
